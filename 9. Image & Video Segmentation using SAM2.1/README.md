# Project Information

In this tutorial, we explore image and video segmentation using SAM 2.1 (Segment Anything Model 2.1). We demonstrate how this advanced AI model efficiently segments objects in both images and videos with high accuracy. This tutorial covers model setup, segmentation techniques, and real-world applications, making it useful for tasks like object detection, autonomous systems, and content editing.
