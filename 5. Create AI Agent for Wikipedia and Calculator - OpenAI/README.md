**Complete Video Tutorial:** https://youtu.be/Uz7pWszyi6k

# Project Information

In this video, we build an AI agent that can retrieve information from Wikipedia and perform calculations using OpenAIâ€™s API. We integrate natural language processing (NLP) to answer queries, fetch relevant data, and handle arithmetic operations seamlessly. This tutorial walks through designing, implementing, and optimizing a multi-functional AI assistant capable of handling both knowledge-based and computational tasks efficiently.
